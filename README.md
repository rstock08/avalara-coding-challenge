# Coding Challenge Instructions
# React assessment
This is a project meant to assess your level of understerstanding of ReactJS. Expect it to take no more than an a few hours. All you are provided is this instruction sheet and mock data provided in a separate file. Take your time, and follow the instructions below.

# Instructions
1. Bootstrap a new React project. Feel free to do it manually, or use a tool like [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

2. The mock data is a set of questions which will need to be displayed in a form. Pull this data into the project however you see fit.

3. Your react app should consist of one single page which displays this form. Each item of the data will need to be displayed in the correct order, and with the correct input type. The "displayOrder" property should be used to determine the order. The "type" property should be used to determine which type of input to show.
4. Each field should display the label over the input, and the description to the right.  ***Only display the description of the currently selected input.*** 
5. Create input handler functions to maintain the state of the form as the user inputs data.

6. Styling is not necessary, but feel free to do so if you'd like.

## *Bonus*
1. Unit test your code with your choice of test frameworks.
2. Use some type of data fetching mechanism to fetch the mock data.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
